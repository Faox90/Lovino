*You can marry him! Pay attention to the setting of private goods! Insufficient ability and no good plot! Zero-based programming may have a lot of bugs. Pay attention! Welcome to feedback and bugs to my email 2318329447@qq.com

You can marry him. Don't mind some out of my personal preference parts of Lovino . There's NO HEARTS EVENTS in this mod because of my lack of programming ability . If there are any bugs or suggestions just send me to 2318329557@qq.com .

*Thanks to Mr. Saevente for the templates ( see this at id18651 ) and programming guide by Mr. Sindy1994 , I would never see Lovino in stardewvalley without their help .
